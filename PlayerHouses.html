<h2>DAWNSTAR - HELJARCHEN HALL</h2>
<p>The land for Heljarchen Hall lies north of Loreius Farm and west of Blizzard Rest. The land can be purchased from the Jarl of Dawnstar who resides in The White Hall. A unique aspect of this property is that you have the option of constructing a grain mill, allowing wheat to be converted into flour. This plot of land becomes available after you finish Waking Nightmare and kill a giant.</p>
<h2>FALKREATH - LAKEVIEW MANOR</h2>
<p>South of Lake Ilinalta, between Falkreath and Riverwood lies the plot for Lakeview Manor. The land can be purchased from the steward at the Jarl's Longhouse in Falkreath. A unique aspect of this property is that you have the option of constructing an apiary, from which honeycombs and bees can be harvested. This plot of land becomes available after you kill some bandits.</p>
<h2>MORTHAL - WINDSTAD MANOR</h2>
<p>The potential location for Windstad Manor is between the Abandoned Shack and High Gate Ruins. The land can be purchased from the steward at Highmoon Hall in Morthal. A unique aspect of Windstad Manor is that a fish hatchery can be built to the north of the property, allowing you to breed and harvest varieties of fish. This plot of land becomes available after you finish Laid to Rest.</p>
<h1>DRAGONBORN DLC HOUSES</h1>
<h2><strong>Severin Manor</strong></h2>
<p>Severin Manor is located in Raven Rock, on Solstheim. Initially it is occupied by Mirri, Tilisu, and Vendil Severin. It can be later awarded to you by Councilor Morvayn as a quest reward for Served Cold. Severin Manor is the only house you can own on Solstheim and features a number of differences from other houses in the game: it is not possible for spouses, stewards, or adopted children to live here, it does not have a housecarl, and it does not have any available upgrades. However, Severin Manor does come complete with fully stocked enchanting, alchemy and armory areas. The house also has several beds you can use and boasts plentiful storage, as well as weapon plaques, display cases and mannequins. In addition, this is the only house you can get for free that doesn't require Creation Club content.</p>
