*Clean Up | This reffers to the quest "Blood on the Ice", where you hunt down the murderer in Windhelm. As you find out in the quest, the house is quite a mess, and this option will remove all of the blood and bones scattered through the house.

<h2 class="toc-header" id="dawnstar-heljarchen-hall"> DAWNSTAR - HELJARCHEN HALL</h2>
<p>The land for Heljarchen Hall lies north of Loreius Farm and west of Blizzard Rest. The land can be purchased from the Jarl of Dawnstar who resides in The White Hall. A unique aspect of this property is that you have the option of constructing a grain mill, allowing wheat to be converted into flour. This plot of land becomes available after you finish Waking Nightmare and kill a giant.</p>
<h2 class="toc-header" id="falkreath-lakeview-manor"> FALKREATH - LAKEVIEW MANOR</h2>
<p>South of Lake Ilinalta, between Falkreath and Riverwood lies the plot for Lakeview Manor. The land can be purchased from the steward at the Jarl's Longhouse in Falkreath. A unique aspect of this property is that you have the option of constructing an apiary, from which honeycombs and bees can be harvested. This plot of land becomes available after you kill some bandits.</p>
<h2 class="toc-header" id="morthal-windstad-manor"> MORTHAL - WINDSTAD MANOR</h2>
<p>The potential location for Windstad Manor is between the Abandoned Shack and High Gate Ruins. The land can be purchased from the steward at Highmoon Hall in Morthal. A unique aspect of Windstad Manor is that a fish hatchery can be built to the north of the property, allowing you to breed and harvest varieties of fish. This plot of land becomes available after you finish Laid to Rest.</p>
<h1 class="toc-header" id="dragonborn-dlc-houses"> DRAGONBORN DLC HOUSES</h1>
<h2 class="toc-header" id="severin-manor"> <strong>Severin Manor</strong></h2>
<p>Severin Manor is located in Raven Rock, on Solstheim. Initially it is occupied by Mirri, Tilisu, and Vendil Severin. It can be later awarded to you by Councilor Morvayn as a quest reward for Served Cold. Severin Manor is the only house you can own on Solstheim and features a number of differences from other houses in the game: it is not possible for spouses, stewards, or adopted children to live here, it does not have a housecarl, and it does not have any available upgrades. However, Severin Manor does come complete with fully stocked enchanting, alchemy and armory areas. The house also has several beds you can use and boasts plentiful storage, as well as weapon plaques, display cases and mannequins. In addition, this is the only house you can get for free that doesn't require Creation Club content.</p>

<p>Clockwork's quest-line will kick off with a random event when your character is at least level 5 and is currently travelling in the Skyrim wilderness. You can also go directly to a certain place to start things off, if you like.</p>
  <details>
  <summary>Spoilers | Where to find the location</summary>
    There's a landslide just south-east from Cragwallow Slope in Eastmarch (south by south-east from Windhelm).
  </details>
<p>This questline is in 4 major parts, and all must be completed before you gain ownership over the castle, and can return to Skyrim</p>
</details>
<blockquote class="is-warning">
<p>IMPORTANT! | When you start this questline you WILL NOT be able to return to skyrim (without using COC commands) until you COMPLETE the 4 part questline.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="is-warning">
<p>IMPORTANT! | You will also not be able to bring any companions with you, unless you're using a companion that's scripted to effectively teleport to you all the time no matter what. It would be best to leave your companion/s behind.<br>
Clockwork should still work if you just HAVE to have them along, but some things may seem a bit weird, and story-wise you're really intended to be alone.</p>
