<p>Gameplay mechanics added by Constellations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Blacksmith Crafting Knowledge</h2>
<p>You need the respective blacksmith book before you can learn a blacksmithing perk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Heavy Armor Drain</h2>
<p>While wearing heavy armor, your Stamina will be drained until you learn the first Heavy Armor perk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Health Regeneration</h2>
<p>You do <strong>not</strong> regenerate health naturally, and food does <strong>not</strong> restore health.<br>The best way to regenerate health over time is by consuming a <strong>Healing Poultice</strong>, which can be purchased from an Alchemist or crafted using a Recipe at a <strong>Tanning Rack</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stamina Management</h2>
<p>When your Stamina is low:</p>
<p>Your attacks deal less damage</p>
<p>Your spells cost more Magicka</p>
<p>Your Stamina regenerates much slower while running</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Horse Inventory</h2>
<p>You can access your horse’s inventory using the <strong>‘Examine’</strong> power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Alternate Action</h2>
<p><strong>Holding Shift</strong> while interacting changes the action:</p>
<p>Take a book instead of reading it</p>
<p>Eat an apple instead of looting it</p>
<p>Equip a weapon instead of looting it</p>
<p>Pet a horse/dog instead of mounting it</p>
<p>Peek through a door instead of entering it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Breaking Locks</h2>
<p><strong>Attacks</strong> can break locks on wooden chests and doors.<br>The level of the lock you can break is based on your <strong>current Health and Stamina </strong>NOT your Maximum.<br>Health is twice as important as stamina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Combat Skill Training</h2>
<p>You can train your combat skills at a <strong>reduced rate</strong> by hitting training dummies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Magic Skill Training</h2>
<p>You can train your magic skills at the <strong>College</strong> by watching the scholars, up to skill level <strong>25</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shouts, powers, rings, spells etc. can all be assigned to groups.</p>
<p>The hotkey for groups 1 to 4 is the keys F1 to F4&nbsp;<br>These keys can be changed in the Sky-ui section of the MCM.&nbsp;<br>If the sky-ui section isn't available, you can change it in the files.</p>

<h2>Armour Material bonuses&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Different armour types give different bonuses depending on what materiel they are made out of, you need the first perk in either evasion or heavy armour for the bonus to be applied to their respective armour pieces. It is not a "set bonus" as each piece gives one instance of the bonus no matter if the full set is worn or not.&nbsp;</p>
