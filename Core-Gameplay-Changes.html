<p>Core Gameplay changes in Constellations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dragonborn or Non-Dragonborn</h2>
<p>By default, your character has a 50/50 chance of being Dragonborn or Non-Dragonborn.<br>Non-Dragonborn characters may not learn or use Shouts by default.<br>These settings can be changed in the <strong>Skyrim Unbound</strong> MCM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Skyrim Main Quest</h2>
<p>The Skyrim Main Quest is only available to <strong>Dragonborn</strong> characters, and will begin the moment the player kills their first dragon as a Dragonborn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Skyrim De-Leveled</h2>
<p>Enemies do <strong>not</strong> scale to your level.<br>This can make some areas and enemies too difficult at low levels.<br>Don't be afraid to run away and come back stronger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>No Fast Travel</h2>
<p>Fast Travel is <strong>disabled by default</strong> in Constellations.<br>However, <strong>Carriages</strong> and <strong>Boats</strong> have an extended list of destinations, and are added to several locations in Skyrim.<br>You can enable Fast Travel in:<br><strong>Requiem MCM → Atmosphere → Fast Travel Allowed</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Standing Stone Restriction</h2>
<p>Once a <strong>Birthsign</strong> is selected, you may only select Birthsigns within that Birthsign's group (<strong>Warrior</strong>, <strong>Mage</strong>, <strong>Thief</strong>, or <strong>Serpent</strong>).<br>See <a href="https://discord.com/channels/607247167588925450/1273513911349547082"><code>⁠cnst-birthsigns</code></a> for more info.<br>&nbsp;</p>
