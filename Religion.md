# **Religion in Constellations**

[Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506?tab=description) adds religion and worship. Pray, worship at shrines, and follow the tenets of your deity to strengthen your bond with the deity and eventually reward you with divine (or unholy) strength. In addition to the Divines and Daedric Princes, there are many other deities from Elder Scrolls lore with their own shrines.

**Following a Deity**

To follow a deity, simply accept their blessing at their shrine. Followers are granted a permanent boon by their patron, for as long as they continue to follow them. [Shrine Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506?tab=docs)

**Prayer and Worship**

Adhere to the Tenets of your deity and pray to them at least once a day to raise Favor with your deity. Worshiping a deity at their shrine grants more Favor than praying. There is no additional benefit to praying in quick succession or for long amounts of time. Not praying for long periods or breaking your patron’s Tenets will cause your Favor to decrease. If Favor drops to 0%, the deity will abandon you.

**Devotee**

Upon reaching 100% Favor, you become a Devotee and receive a second boon that is a dramatic manifestation of your deity's power on Tamriel.

**Starting Religion**

At the start of your playthrough, when you first step outside, you may choose a deity based on your race.

**Relics**

Rare lost artifacts of holy or unholy power exist that will improve your relationship with your deity...

**Lore**

Most of the lore in this guide is pulled directly from the [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (UESP)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page). Click on the blue links in this guide to learn more about the deities, races, and religions of The Elder Scrolls.

## [The Divines](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Divines)

*The Divines are the Aedric deities which make up the official pantheon of the Cyrodilic Empire, and thus have been worshiped all across Tamriel. Their membership was defined by Saint Alessia at the founding of the First Empire in the aftermath of the rebellion she led, blending the Aldmeri religion her people had adopted from their Ayleid captors with the Nordic Pantheon of the people of Skyrim.*

*This new pantheon would stand for thousands of years, until Tiber Septim's reunification of Tamriel and declaration of the Third Era. Upon his death, so great were his deeds that he achieved apotheosis and joined the ranks of the Divines as Talos.*

<details>
  <summary>Divine Worship</summary>
  The Divines welcome any who would worship them into the fold, no matter their race or previous deities. Divine favor is slow to build, but the Divines are merciful and their faithful are unlikely to fall out of favor, unless they overtly commit crimes or ignore their religious duties for a long period of time.

## [The Daedric Princes](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daedric_Princes)

*Daedric Princes are the most powerful of the Daedra, and thus most commonly worshiped as gods. Each has a particular sphere, which it is said to govern. The Daedric Princes seem to view Men and Mer as little more than minor amusements, occasionally applauding the actions of mortals when they exceed their expectations. They do not know the mortal sense of 'good' and 'evil', and usually have extremist tendencies, which is why Men and Mer fear them greatly.*

<details>
  <summary>Daedric Worship</summary>
  Most Daedric Princes only accept the worship of those they deem worthy of their attention. Gaining favor is not too challenging, as long as one is willing to commit unsavory acts, but favor also diminishes faster. As a result, prayer alone is not enough to reach devotee status and Daedra worshippers must actively follow their tenets to build up favor. There is no such thing as paying lip service to a Daedric Prince!
  </details>

<details>
  <summary>Daedric Temptations</summary>
  When you interact with a Daedric Prince during a quest or read about their deeds of might and glory, the Daedric Prince may offer you to immediately become their follower, regardless of your race or other requirements.

Should you decline the Temptation, the Daedric Prince will not ask again, so choose wisely. (If you decline, you can still become a follower of the Daedric Prince by visiting their shrine.)

## [The Elven Ancestors](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Altmer)
>The body of the divine wills us into being. Venerate the gods as one. For we are one with the gods.

The [Altmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Varieties_of_Faith:_The_High_Elves) and [Bosmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Varieties_of_Faith:_The_Wood_Elves) believe themselves to be descended from the divine Aedra who populated Mundus after Lorkhan deceived them into creating the mortal plane. Many of the deities they worship are the most powerful or well-known of these ancestors.

The priests of Auri-El teach that the Hand of Auri-El, the Eye of Magnus, the Arm of Trinimac, the Bones of Y'ffre, the Mouth of Xarxes, and the Heart of Mara form a single 'divine body' which must be venerated as one, and with which the Altmer themselves are one.

<details>
  <summary>Elven Ancestor Worship</summary>

## [The Yokudan Pantheon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Yokuda)

*The Yokudan faith was built around the concept of Satakal consuming the world to begin another. They believed Satakal has done this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition, notably Ruptga, the first who learned how to do so. Ruptga set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, and these spirits ultimately became the Yokudan pantheon. The Redguards brought many of these deities with them from their ancestral home of Yokuda.*

*This new pantheon would stand for thousands of years, until Tiber Septim's reunification of Tamriel and declaration of the Third Era. Upon his death, so great were his deeds that he achieved apotheosis and joined the ranks of the Divines as Talos.*

<details>
  <summary>Yokudan Worship</summary>
  The gods of the Redguards aid their followers in straightforward and effective ways. Many Redguard deities, particularly those of the [Forebears](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Varieties_of_Faith,_The_Forebears), mirror the Imperial pantheon. However Redguards, especially the [Crowns](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Varieties_of_Faith,_Crown_Redguards), also have their own unique deities that are not worshiped anywhere else on Nirn. The Yokudan pantheon does not penalize worshippers for committing crimes.
