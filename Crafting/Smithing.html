<h3>Smithing</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>Smithing is one of the core crafting skills in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Constellations, allowing players to forge, temper, and improve weapons and armor. It is invaluable for adventurers who want the strongest equipment possible and provides a reliable path for both power progression and wealth.</p>
<p>Whether you’re preparing for battle against dragons, optimizing your armor for exploration, or simply creating valuable gear to sell, Smithing can play a vital role in your playstyle.</p>

<h3>Basic Mechanics</h3>
<p>Smithing involves using 5 basic equipments.</p>
<p><strong>Smelter:</strong><br>Used to smelt ore into ingots.</p>
<p><strong>Tanning Rack:</strong><br>Used to convert pelt from fallen animals into usable leather and leather strips. Additionally allows to create tents, cloaks and backpacks.</p>
<p><strong>Forge &amp; Anvils:</strong><br>Used mainly to convert materials into armours, weapons and jewelery.</p>
<p><strong>Workbenches &amp; Grindstones:</strong><br>In addition to creating items, you can use grindstones to improve weapons and workbenches to improve armor. This process increases their damage or defense, with improvements scaling according to your Smithing skill level and perks.</p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong><br>Smithing relies on raw materials such as ingots, leather, and hides. These materials can be mined, purchased, or salvaged from loot. For example:</p>
<p>Iron Ingot – Common, used in basic gear.</p>
<p>Steel Ingot – A mix of iron and corundum.</p>
<p>Leather &amp; Leather Strips – Derived from animal hides, required for almost every crafting recipe.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting Process:</strong></p>
<p>Gather the required ingots, leather, and special components.</p>
<p>Head to a forge or anvil.</p>
<p>Select the weapon or armor type you want to create.</p>
<p>Use a grindstone or workbench to improve its stats further.</p>

<h3>Armour Material bonuses&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Different armour types give different bonuses depending on what materiel they are made out of, you need the first perk in either evasion or heavy armour for the bonus to be applied to their respective armour pieces.
