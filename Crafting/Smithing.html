<h3>Basic Mechanics</h3>
<p>Smithing involves using 5 basic equipments.</p>
<p><strong>Smelter:</strong><br>Used to smelt ore into ingots.</p>
<p><strong>Tanning Rack:</strong><br>Used to convert pelt from fallen animals into usable leather and leather strips. Additionally allows to create tents, cloaks and backpacks.</p>
<p><strong>Forge &amp; Anvils:</strong><br>Used mainly to convert materials into armours, weapons and jewelery.</p>
<p><strong>Workbenches &amp; Grindstones:</strong><br>In addition to creating items, you can use grindstones to improve weapons and workbenches to improve armor. This process increases their damage or defense, with improvements scaling according to your Smithing skill level and perks.</p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong><br>Smithing relies on raw materials such as ingots, leather, and hides. These materials can be mined, purchased, or salvaged from loot. For example:</p>
<p>Iron Ingot – Common, used in basic gear.</p>
<p>Steel Ingot – A mix of iron and corundum.</p>
<p>Leather &amp; Leather Strips – Derived from animal hides, required for almost every crafting recipe.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting Process:</strong></p>
<p>Gather the required ingots, leather, and special components.</p>
<p>Head to a forge or anvil.</p>
<p>Select the weapon or armor type you want to create.</p>

<h3>Leveling tips and tricks.</h3>
<p>Leveling Smithing is tied with value for each crafted equipment, higher value items grant more experience towards level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most reliable way of getting ahead with levels is to process high value materials such as Ebony and Gold.</p>
<p>Gold can easily be obtained by mining Kolskeggr Mine, located east of Markath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ebony involves dealing with Orsimer Stringholds, one with Ebony Mine, Narzulbur is located east of Windhelm. You can get access by completing quest for them or by force.</p>
<p>After you get to level 50, unlock perk Advanced Smithing, which allows to create jewelery. Then use smelted ores to craft jewelery, keep in mind that higher value means more experience, so using gems found during mining or in open world will give you most valuable jewelery. You can get bunch of valuable gems by beating Ragnok located north of Whiterun.</p>
