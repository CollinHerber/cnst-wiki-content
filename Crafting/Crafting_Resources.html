  <li>You can predict potion/poison effect if you are using known ingridients, in case of using unknown ingridients the potion will have unknown effect, and in some cases it will fail.</li>
  <li>Mixing more ingridients of the same effect <strong>will not</strong> increase its potency. Potency is related to <strong>ingridient effect strenght</strong>, meaning that each ingridient you find with the same effect will have different impact on your poison/potion values.</li>
  <li>Always mix one ingridient with strong desired effect with other weaker ingridient.</li>
  <li>Some ingridients are easier to get from merchants, you should always check them out for rare ingridients.</li>

<h2><a href="https://cnst.collinthedev.com/en/Crafting/Smithing">Smithing</a></h2>
<p>Smithing value depends on the value of the item created (before any build-in enchantments) therefor crafting high value items is highly encouraged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most reliable way of getting ahead with levels is to process high value materials such as Ebony and Gold.</p>
<p>Gold Ore can easily be obtained by mining Kolskeggr Mine, located east of Markath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ebony Ore involves dealing with Orsimer Stringholds, one with Ebony Mine, Narzulbur is located east of Windhelm. You can get access by completing quest for them or by force.</p>
<p>Mentioned ways are not the only way of getting said ores!</p>
<p>After you get to level 50 of Smithing, unlock perk Advanced Blacksmithing, which allows to create jewelery. Then use smelted ores to craft jewelery, keep in mind that higher value means more experience, so using gems found during mining or in open world will give you most valuable jewelery. You can get bunch of valuable gems by beating Ragnok located north of Whiterun.</p>
<h4>Bonuses to smithing</h4>
