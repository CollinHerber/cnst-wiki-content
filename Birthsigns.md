Birthsigns are powerful blessings granted by the Constellations that spread across the skies of Tamriel. Each constellation falls under the protection of one of the Guardians: The Mage, The Thief, and The Warrior. Once you select a Birthsign, your character is locked to the Birthsigns that fall under the protection of that Constellation's Guardian.

Birthsigns are selected when you create a character and can be exchanged for another Birthsign with the same Guardian by activating Standing Stones.

### Mage

The Mage birthsign and its three charges. Once you select one of these Birthsigns, you may not select any birthsign of the other two Guardians or The Serpent.
