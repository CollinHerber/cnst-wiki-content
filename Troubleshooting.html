<h2>WIP</h2>
<h2><strong><u>Constellations Troubleshooting</u></strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vortex errors</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1. Failed to install dependency</strong></h3>
<p>Click on "more".</p>
<p>If it says that it failed with code <strong>429</strong> this means you have exceeded the nexus daily API request limit, it fully resets at midnight GMT, but some small parts are restored every hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Missing masters</h3>
<p>When you get the error, click on 'more', you will see two lists of plugins we are interested in the right one, those are the missing ones (left list is list of plugins that require the missing ones)</p>
<p>Check which plugins are missing. If any of them begin with “CC” that indicates you are missing the Creation Club content that is included in the AE DLC. To install them:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>In Mods, select 'Purge Mods'.,</li>
    <li>Verify integrity of game files in Steam,</li>
    <li>Launch the game vanilla,</li>
    <li>Install the AE DLC in the 'Creations' menu by clicking 'o' and selecting: 'Download all owned creation...',</li>
    <li>Head to the Skyrim directory Data folder <code>Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data</code> and ensure you have 148 files starting with <code>cc</code> (if you don't have 148, follow steps 2-4 again or try to download them manually from CC menu in game),</li>
    <li>Deploy mods and sort your plugins,</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. </strong>If the plugins do not begin with "CC", deploy mods, navigate to Plugins, filter by 'Disabled' and enable any disabled plugins.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> If you still have missing masters and not other vortex warnings/errors, post screenshot of the list in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/607247167588925450/1273468869293379627"><u>#cnst-support</u></a> channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/wsnhHJKSA7">discord</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Missing Masters</strong></h3>
<p>Missing masters will cause your game to crash at launch or not load. Ensure you have installed the Anniversary Edition DLC Creation Club content in the Skyrim main menu prior to installing Constellations and that you have enabled all disabled plugins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Mod Conflicts/Missing Mod Rules</strong></h3>
<p>Uninstall any mods not included in Constellations and follow the instructions posted below. If you have an excessive number of unresolved mod rules, reinstall the collection according to the instructions below. If any unresolved mod rules remain, post a screenshot of them in ⁠cnst-support</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Mod Cycles</strong></h3>
<p>Mod cycles are usually the result of attempting to resolve Mod Conflicts by yourself. Uninstall any mods not included in Constellations and reinstall the collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Game Crashes at Startup or Won't Load</strong></h3>
<p>This is usually due to missing masters or improperly sorted plugins. See Missing Masters above and ensure you have sorted plugins and waited for the process to finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Game Crashes Repeatedly During Gameplay</strong></h3>
<p>This is usually result of user hardware and/or having your graphics setting set too high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>SKSE64 Loader Error</strong></h3>
<p>SKSE64 Loader errors are usually from manually installing the wrong version of SKSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
