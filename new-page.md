## [Altmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Altmer)

*The Altmer of Summerset Isle are called 'High' Elves in the Empire, describing both their physical appearance and their snobbish personality. The arcane ability of High Elves surpasses all other races in Tamriel. They are weak in physical combat, however, and their magic affinity makes them more susceptible to hostile spells.*

## [Bosmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bosmer)

*The Bosmer, or Wood Elves, originate from the sacred forest of Valenwood. Their culture is highly carnivorous and even cannibalistic, derived from the Green Pact with the forest, in which they harm no plant. Their dexterity makes them excellent scouts and thieves, and there are no finer archers in all of Tamriel. They have a natural resistance to diseases and, once per day, can command nearby animals to fight for them.*

## [Breton](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Breton)

While Bretons are physically weak, they can tap on magicka more than any other human race and they are particularly capable in the school of Conjuration. Their magic resistance blocks a portion of incoming spell damage and enables them to absorb magicka from hostile spells.*

Every Imperial possesses at least basic rhetoric knowledge, allowing them to haggle for many bargains.*

## [Khajiit](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khajiit)

*The Khajiit are a race of feline humanoids hailing from the province of Elsweyr, well-known as great merchants but also as smugglers and thieves. They are very fast and outrun all other races which, combined with a high stamina reserve, makes them fearsome skirmishers. However, they are seldom gifted with the skill to harness magical forces. All Khajiit can see in the dark at will and eat raw meat, and their sharp claws are as lethal as knives.*

Nords have an innate ability to channel the Storm's Voice, also called Thu'um, reducing the time between shouts.*

## [Orsimer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orc)

*The Orsimer or 'Pariah Folk', commonly called Orcs, come from Orsinium in the west. Their savage appearance and customs sometimes cause fear, but they have won acceptance for their distinguished service in the Legion. Orcs' superior strength makes them formidable warriors, though use of magic requires extensive training. They fall into a wild rage that reduces their ability to feel pain and increases physical damage dealt while they are on the brink of death.*

*The dark-skinned, wiry-haired Redguards of Hammerfell seem born for battle, though their proud and independent spirits suit free-ranging heroism more. They have a hardy constitution and natural resistance to poison and disease, but tend to shun their magic. The Redguards' innate agility and high level of endurance allows them to excel in any activity that demands sustained effort.*
