<h3><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
<p>In <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Constelations</i>, <strong>Alchemy</strong> is one of the many skills available to players, allowing them to craft potions, poisons, and other useful items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a powerful mechanic that can help you in combat, exploration, and even in making money.</p>
<h3><strong>Basic Mechanics:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Alchemy Lab:</strong> To create potions or poisons, you need to find or use an Alchemy Lab. These labs can be found in various places like towns, inns, and your personal home if you've invested in one.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> The most important part of alchemy is the ingredients. Skyrim has a huge variety of ingredients scattered throughout the world, each with unique effects. Common ingredients include plants like <i>Purple Mountain Flower</i>, mushrooms like <i>Blisterwort</i>, and other substances like <i>Honeycomb</i> and <i>Horker Tusks</i>.</p>
<p><strong>Effect Discovery:</strong> Ingredients have known effects, but at first, you won't know all the effects. You'll need to experiment with ingredients by mixing them or by eating them, this way you will learn their properties. Once you learn an ingredient's properties, you can use it in crafting potions or poisons that have desired effects.</p>
<p><strong>Potion Creation:</strong> To create a potion, you combine up to three ingredients that have beneficial effect in an Alchemy Lab.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Poison Creation:</strong> To create a poison, you combine up to three ingredients that have negative effect in an Alchemy Lab.&nbsp;</p>
