<h1><strong>Religion in Constellations</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506?tab=description">Wintersun</a> adds religion and worship. Pray, worship at shrines, and follow the tenets of your deity to strengthen your bond with the deity and eventually reward you with divine (or unholy) strength. In addition to the Divines and Daedric Princes, there are many other deities from Elder Scrolls lore with their own shrines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Following a Deity</strong></p>
<p>To follow a deity, simply accept their blessing at their shrine. Followers are granted a permanent boon by their patron, for as long as they continue to follow them. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506?tab=docs">Shrine Locations</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prayer and Worship</strong></p>
<p>Adhere to the Tenets of your deity and pray to them at least once a day to raise Favor with your deity. Worshiping a deity at their shrine grants more Favor than praying. There is no additional benefit to praying in quick succession or for long amounts of time. Not praying for long periods or breaking your patronâ€™s Tenets will cause your Favor to decrease. If Favor drops to 0%, the deity will abandon you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Devotee</strong></p>
<p>Upon reaching 100% Favor, you become a Devotee and receive a second boon that is a dramatic manifestation of your deity's power on Tamriel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Starting Religion</strong></p>
<p>At the start of your playthrough, when you first step outside, you may choose a deity based on your race.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Relics</strong></p>
<p>Rare lost artifacts of holy or unholy power exist that will improve your relationship with your deity...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
