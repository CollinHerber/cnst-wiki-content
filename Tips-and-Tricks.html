<h3>Carry Weight</h3>
<p>Of course no Bethesda game is complete without encumbrance. Here are a few tips and tricks to increase your carry weight to maximize your loot hauls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Backpacks</h4>
<p>The best way to increase your carry weight is to take advantage of the backpacks that have been added. There are a few sources of Backpacks including the <a href="https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer's_Backpack">Adventures Backpacks CC Mod</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667">Campfire Mod</a></p>
<p>Backpacks are a new equip slot that increase your carry capacity. They can be worn over cloaks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Health + Stamina Leveling</h4>
<p>Increasing your Health and Stamina through level ups will also increase your carry weight. Health provides more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Spells</h4>
<p>If you need a temporary boost you can look to spells such as Transmute Muscle and the far worst version Brisk Step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Bags of holding</h4>
<p>Bags of holding give +60 carryweight just for existing in your inventory, there is 11 in total placed around the map at the end of important or long questchains.</p>
